# Business Site

The aim of this project was to build a business web site containing a responsive hero section, a form and an accordion.

## The problem

I built the structure and layout of my website with Flexbox to get a responsive site, starting with mobile view and then added media queries for larger viewports.
The accordion was built with Javascript and the form with HTML tools.
The Hero images in the header are placed inside a <picture> tag with srcset keywords to enable switching images between the viewport sizes.

If I would have had more time, I would have added a Navbar and also changed font sizes between viewport sizes.
